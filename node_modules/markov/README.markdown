qwantz
------

qwantz.js:

    var util = require('util');
    var fs = require('fs');
    
    var markov = require('markov');
    var m = markov(1);
    
    var s = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/qwantz.txt');
    m.seed(s, function () {
        var stdin = process.openStdin();
        util.print('> ');
        
        stdin.on('data', function (line) {
            var res = m.respond(line.toString()).join(' ');
            console.log(res);
            util.print('> ');
        });
    });

methods
=======

markov(order)
-------------

Create a new markov object of order `order`, which defaults to 2.

.seed(s, cb)
------------

Seed the markov object with a string or stream `s`.

If `s` is a string, transition probabilities will be updated for every grouping
of the previously specified order with dangling links at the front and end in
the appropriate direction.

If `s`s is a stream, data events will be line-buffered and fed into `.seed()` again
line-by-line.

If `cb` is specified it will fire once the seed text is fully ingested.

.search(text)
-------------

Search for and return some key found in the text body `text`.

Return `undefined` if no matches were found.

.pick()
-------

Choose a key at random.

.next(key)
----------

Find a key likely to follow after `key`.

Returns a hash with keys `key`, the canonical next key and `word`, a raw form of
`key` as it appeared in the seed text.

.prev(key)
----------

Find a key likely to come before `key`.

Returns a hash with keys `key`, the canonical next key and `word`, a raw form of
`key` as it appeared in the seed text.

.forward(key, limit)
--------------------

Generate a markov chain forward starting at `key` and returning an array of the
raw word forms along the way.

Stop when the traversal hits a terminal entry or when limit words have been
generated if limit is specified.

.backward(key, limit)
---------------------

Generate a markov chain backward starting at `key` and returning an array of the
raw word forms along the way.

Stop when the traversal hits a terminal entry or when limit words have been
generated if limit is specified.

.fill(key, limit)
-----------------

Generate a markov chain in both directions starting at `key`. Return an array of
the raw word forms along the way including the raw word form of the supplied
`key`.

Stop when the traversal hits a terminal entry or when limit words have been
generated if limit is specified.

.respond(text, limit)
---------------------

Search for a starting key in `text` and then call `.fill(key, limit)` on it.
