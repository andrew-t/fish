Today is a beautiful day to be stomping on things! As a dinosaur, stomping is the best part of my day indeed!
*gasp*
What's that, little house? You wish you were back in your own time? THAT IS TOO BAD FOR YOU
Perhaps you too will get a stomping little girl!
WAIT!
Is stomping really the answer to your problem(s)?
Problem(s)?
My only problem(s) have to do with you interrupting my stomping!
crazy utahraptor!
With that Utahraptor out of the way I feel better! A rare pleasure indeed, to have your problems put behind you and the future full of promise!
Imagine if that Utahraptor slipped in the shower?
He'd certainly wish he'd stomped the soap out of the way (much as I now stomp this little house) as he passed on!
Perhaps in his last moments, the irony of the situation - from my perspective - would become evident.
Yes, I will freely enjoy stomping more now that he is gone!
Stop!
You?
You have retreated too far into the realm of fantasy and have forgotten that I did not in fact expire in the shower!
I must guard against such self-absorption in the future!
I GUESS THERE IS A LESSON HERE FOR US ALL!
I feel today that my actions will be charged with symbolism.
*gasp*
As a male, I take on the position of the Everyman - with the latter syllable perhaps most important from our post-feminist perspective. The house clearly represents repressed feminity, at once recalling the blissful days of the past, while reminding us of their fundamental injustices.
My action in destroying the house remains a puzzling enigma.
The emphasis on male oppression is continued as I stand poised to crush this woman beneath my man-foot.
No!
I've always seen you as representing the essential struggle between man and his darker half.
Oh, that is a part of it, to be sure.
...but the desires of my darker nature manifest themselves as misogyny!
Surely that must enter into your analysis!
I had a friend (female) who dated her roommate (also female).
Lesbians!
Of course, there's always a danger when you go down the 'date-the-person-you-live-with' road. It could fall apart, not unlike this tiny house.
They broke up a week later and still had to live together.
The sting of a failed romance!
I know it well.
I too have consummated my love for my roommate of the same gender. Now when I see him (quite often, as it turns out) there is a tension that hurts me.
Right here.
Later...
!
The realization that I've had a homosexual affair with the Utahraptor THAT I CANNOT REMEMBER AT ALL profoundly disturbs me. How could I forget such a thing?
I wonder what it was like? Maybe I was really good!
Or MAYBE he's making the whole thing up! That would explain why I don't remember it.
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.
Yes! Thank you!
I feel alot better about the whole thing now.
But I have proof!
You? What manner of proof have you?
Uh
well
*gasp*
